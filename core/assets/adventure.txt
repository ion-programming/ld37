You open the door to see Gary the innkeeper.\n"Gombledeen, I'm glad you're home. I'm in a spot of trouble, and I was hoping you could help. I haven't received my order of cheese wheels this week, and I'm worried that the chaps carting it might have run into some trouble out on the north mountain pass. Do you think you could look into it for me?"
